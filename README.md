# Dynamic AI Ecosystem Project

This project aims to create a dynamic ecosystem of interconnected, open-source generative AI models that cooperate to improve response quality, optimize energy consumption, refine human language for machine processing, and divide and conquer complex queries.

## Core Concepts

1.  **Interconnected AI Network:**
    *   Multiple open-source generative AI models are connected in a dynamic network.
    *   These models interact and provide feedback to each other, constantly refining their responses.

2.  **Collaborative Refinement:**
    *   AI models refine each other's prompts and outputs through continuous feedback loops.
    *   The system collectively improves its accuracy and quality over time.

3.  **Energy-Aware Model Selection:**
    *   The system intelligently selects the most energy-efficient model suitable for a given task.
    *   This minimizes energy consumption by avoiding the use of larger, more resource-intensive models when unnecessary.

4.  **Human-Machine Language Optimization:**
    *   The system refines human language into a format that is more readily understandable by machines.
    *   Human queries are automatically transformed into optimized prompts without manual intervention.

5.  **Dynamic Query Routing & Decomposition:**
    *   Instead of a user selecting a specific AI model, the system automatically distributes a query among several models.
    *   Complex queries are divided into smaller parts and processed in parallel by specialized models.
    *   The system aggregates the best insights from each model to generate a comprehensive and unified response.

6. **Specialized Models:**
    * Each model specializes in specific tasks according to its strengths (e.g., creativity, mathematical precision).

7. **Self-Correction and Internal Feedback:**
    *   The system uses a mini-cycle of internal feedback among models to compare and correct their own answers before presenting a final response to the human.

## Advanced Capabilities

*   The system will dynamically measure the "computational cost" and "accuracy gain" in real-time.
*   Shared embeddings across models for better understanding of divided questions.
*   Self-training in "energy optimization".
*   Auto-evolution of a set of best base prompts for different types of queries.
*   Implementation of a small "consensus tribunal" where several models vote on the best response to present.
