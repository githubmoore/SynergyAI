# SynergyAI – Executive Presentation

# **What is SynergyAI?**

SynergyAI is an ecosystem of generative AI models that collaborate with each other to solve complex tasks more efficiently, ethically and humanely.

Instead of relying on a single model, SynergyAI splits queries between coordinated specialized models, improving results and reducing energy consumption.

# **What problem does it solve?**

Currently, users must switch between multiple AI tools for different tasks, generating interruptions, unnecessary consumption, and inconsistent results.

SynergyAI integrates and orchestrates different models from a single collaborative interface.

# **How does it work?**

\- Division of complex tasks between specialized models  
\- Language refinement before shipping  
\- Smart orchestration based on task type  
\- Final response unified with text, image or code

# **Why is it ethical and sustainable?**

\- Lower energy consumption due to precise use of models  
\- Accessibility for non-technical users  
\- Transparency in model decisions  
\- Educational and social potential
