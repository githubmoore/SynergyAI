# **App Name**: SynergyAI

## Core Features:

- Dynamic Query Routing: Implement a dynamic routing system to distribute incoming queries among various open-source AI models, selecting the most suitable model based on the nature of the query.
- Self-Prompting Optimization: Establish a self-prompting optimization module where AI models iteratively improve their prompts based on feedback from other models, enhancing response accuracy and efficiency.
- Energy-Aware Model Selection: Develop an energy-aware selection mechanism that dynamically chooses the most energy-efficient model for a given task, optimizing resource utilization without sacrificing performance. The system measures the "cost computacional" and the "gain in precision" to help the tool decide when is better to use more resources or not.
- Collaborative Output Refinement: Integrate a collaborative refinement process where multiple AI models review and correct each other's outputs through an internal feedback loop before presenting the final result.
- System Monitoring Dashboard: Develop a dashboard to monitor model performance, energy consumption, and optimization metrics.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Deep teal (#008080) to convey intelligence and interconnectedness.
- Secondary color: Light grey (#D3D3D3) to maintain a professional and clean aesthetic.
- Accent: Electric purple (#8F00FF) for interactive elements and visual emphasis.
- Clear and modern typography to ensure readability.
- Use consistent and intuitive icons for system functions and metrics.
- Clean, modular layout to allow easy access to real-time feedback.
- Subtle transitions to communicate process flow and outcomes.
